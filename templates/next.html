          <h1>Take on the 10K for Team Theo!</h1>
          <p>

            It's back ... following its huge success in its first two years, the much-talked-about Asda Foundation Sheffield 10K returns on Sunday 23rd September 2018.
<br /></br />
Thousands of runners took part in 2017, and itâ€™s set to be even bigger and better in 2018, so secure your place now! Staged in partnership with Sheffield City Council, this 10K has a fantastic course right through the heart of the Steel City.
<br /></br />
Route: Runners will take on a fantastic city centre route, starting in Arundel Gate, and taking runners on a journey along Charter Row and along Ecclesall Road, before skirting the edges of pretty Endcliffe Park. It continues along Riverdale Road, along Endcliffe Vale Road, close to the Botanical Gardens, then travels down Brocco Bank and back to an exhilarating city centre finish.
<br /></br />
You can even get the whole family involved with the Arena Group Sheffield Family Fun Run, open to everyone aged 3 and above! So even, our youngest Team Theo members can be a part of this one!

          </p>
